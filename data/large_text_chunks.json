The lad\u2019s crude attempts at soil alterations generally resulted in\nthe death of her flowers so, naturally, his mother quickly stopped Max's\ncuriosity as to changing her plants\u2019 soil nutrition.\n\nWhen the young man was ready to graduate from high s",

He used measures for\nthe successful management of patients suffering from body system\ndeterioration of all types, most especially tuberculosis, kidney diseases,\ndiabetes, liver diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, gallbladder disease, nearly\nevery addiction, and almost all of the over one hundred kinds of malignancies.\n\nDr. Gerson\u2019s therapeutic techniques involved having each patient use an\nintegrated set of particular health care methods and managements, in",

The information came from a\nstudy conducted by Harold D. Foster, B.Sc., Ph.D., Professor of Geography and a\nstatistician with the University of Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.\nIn 1988, Dr. Foster performed a thorough\n\nDr. and Mrs. John Albracht\ncomputer analysis of cancer patients who underwent so-called spontaneous\nregressions.\n\nSpontaneous regression (or spontaneous remission) means that the cancer gets\nsmaller or disappears completely (and with no new tumors developing) without\nany conventional treatment.?\n\nThe renowned pathologist William Boyd, M_D., collected a large series of such\nRemission \u2014 How It Happens 59\n\ninstances, all documented in great detail, in a book he published in 1961.

The caffeine drug in coffee ad-\nministered as an enema definitely detoxifies the liver and is a primary\ntherapeutic approach of the Gerson Therapy. \u201cThis treatment should be\nfollowed strictly, both in the clinic and later at home, for at least two years. . . .\nThe liver is the main organ for the regeneration of the body\u2019s metabolism for the\ntransformation of food from intake to output,\u201d writes Dr. Gerson.\u2019\n\nDuring a 1985 conference on cancer treatment conducted by the late\nalternative treatment cancer specialist Harold Manner, Ph.D., held at King of\nPrussia, Pennsylvania, Dr. Manner discussed the internal workings of a coffee\nenema.

The next few\nparagraphs are paraphrased from Dr.\n\nManners description of the body's cleansing mechanism that occurs when the\ncoffee enema is administered.\n\nWhile the coffee enema is being retained in the gut (for an optimum period\nranging from twelve to fifteen minutes), all of the body's blood passes through\nthe liver every three minutes. The hemorrhoidal blood vessels dilate from\nexposure to the caffeine; in turn, the liver\u2019s portal veins dilate too.\nLiver D\u00e9toxifications with Coffee Enemas 157\n\nSimultaneously, the bile ducts expand with blood, the bile flow increases, and\nthe smooth muscles of these internal organs relax.

On the Gerson Therapy the rules are different. We must\nstudy water from a number of angles to understand why this rule changes.\n\nFirst, when people eat a salty diet, they are naturally thirsty, for our human\nphysiology forces them to drink enough water to hold excess sodium in solution.\nIf it is too concentrated, sodium buildup causes problems in the blood serum as\nwell as in the cells.\n\nThe sodium in salt can kill As reported worldwide, on July 27, 1999,\n\nLeroy Elders, a three-month-old baby boy in Great Britain, died of a salt overdose\nafter his young parents fed him adult food.

The amount of\nsodium was too high for the baby\u2019s kidneys to process, and it poisoned him to\ndeath.\u201d2\n\nSecond, another cause of thirst is eating a diet high in animal proteins and fats.\nThe intermediate or end-products of protein and fat digestion are disturbing to\nthe system and cause the person consuming them to feel thirsty.

These\ntwo particular components of the Gerson Therapy diet add up to about 4 liters of\nfluid intake daily, which is more than adequate for human needs.\n\nSome patients on the Gerson program, however, still request additional\nliquids, or they awaken during some nights with the need to drink more fluids.\nSince ill persons such as these are not allowed to drink water, they should be\nprovided with herbal teas, such as peppermint, orange blossom, linden blossom,\nand/or tahebo (lapacho or pau d\u2019arco). A quantity of such teas should be stored\nin a thermos bottle on a night table, right next to the bed.

As shown, fluoridated and/or\nchlorinated drinking water becomes the source of such thyroid gland pathology.\n\nAnother problem of low thyroid function is the development and deposit of\nplaque in the arteries, called arteriosclerosis or hardening of the arteries. This\nleads to poor blood supply to the heart, the brain, and the extremities. Too often,\nheart attacks and strokes are the result of arteriosclerosis. Endocrinologist Broda\nBarnes, M.D., demonstrated that low thyroid function and heart attacks are\ndirectly related.

Consequently, the first successful application of\nchemotherapy took place at Yale in the mid-1940s with personnel of that\nuniversity adapting mustard gas as a method of cancer management. From this\npractice, alkylating agents were created as cytotoxic therapy.

Why have certain\njuices been chosen? Why are they used in specific ways? For what reasons must\nthe juices be made fresh? These are only a few of the questions asked of us by\nGerson patients. We answer them in the following manner:\n\nDuring the course of Dr. Max Gerson\u2019s thirty years of clinical practice (1928\nto 1958) his anti-degenerative-disease therapy changed considerably. The\nvariation occurred in the quantity, volume, and type of juices prescribed. Over\nthe years, many patients have successfully used nothing more than the single\ntable of juices and medications published in the sixth edition of Dr. Gerson\u2019s\nbook, A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty Cases, as ",

Surely, oxidation of a quantity of juice that\u2019s\nbeen sitting for an interval of time causes loss of certain vitamins and enzymes.\nOxygen will do that.\n\nThere has been much discussion of the enzyme activity in the juices when\nthey are fresh. The importance of these enzymes in numerous biochemical\nfunctions is well accepted. Yet, as any biology student knows, enzymes are\nimmediately destroyed on contact with stomach acid. What makes the\ndifference in healing response between the fresh juice and the hours-old juice?\nOne possibility is that some of the enzymes present in the fresh juice are\nabsorbed directly through the mucous membranes in the mouth and\nesophagus, before reaching the stomach.

In the blood, normal K* levels range from 3.8\nto 5.5 mEq/liter (mmol/L).\n\nVital to maintaining electrical conduction within the cardiac and skeletal\nmuscles, K+ is affected by variations in the secretion of adrenal steroid\nhormones and by fluctuations in pH, serum glucose levels, and serum sodium\nlevels. A reciprocal relationship exists between K*+ and Na*; the substantial\nintake of one causes a corresponding decrease in the other. Although the body\nreadily conserves sodium, potassium deficiency may develop rapidly and is\nquite common, because there is no efficient method for conserving potassium.\n\nThe laboratory test for serum potassium is used to evaluate clinical signs of\neither potassium excess (/ryperkalenua) or potassium depletion (Iypokalenna).

Formed in the liver from ammonia and excreted by the kidneys,\nurea constitutes 40 to 50 percent of the blood\u2019s nonprotein nitrogen. The BUN\nlevel reflects protein intake and kidney excretory capacity, but it\u2019s a less reliable\nindicator of uremia (urine in the blood) than the serum creatinine level (see the\ntest description which immediately follows).\n\nWith normal values ranging from 8 to 20 mg/dL, the BUN test helps to\nevaluate kidney function, aids in the diagnosis of kidney illness, and assesses\nthe body\u2019s hydration.

The problem, of course, is\nthe mercury, a highly poisonous heavy metal with powerful adverse effects on\nthe nervous system Once installed in teeth, the mercury steadily leaches out\ninto the body and is carried throughout the system by blood circulation.\n\nSome people are a great deal more sensitive to this circulating mercury than\nothers, and it's been proven to cause multiple sclerosis",
